      <p id="p30">An overview of Galway's long history, centered around the Galway City Museum on Spanish Arch.</p>
<p>Galway is one of Ireland's most storied locations, with a history going back almost a thousand years. Read below about a mere sample of the many fascinating events to have happened throughout Galway's history.</p>
<h2 id="h2">Early History</h2>
<p>The earliest origins of Galway involve a fort that was built in 1124 by the High King of Ireland, Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair. Originally called 'Fort at the Mouth of the Gaillimh', Ua Conchobair used the fort as a naval base. While it was attacked in 1132
and 1149, Galway remained under the control of the O'Flaherty clan until the Norman invasion of Connacht, falling to Richard Mor de Burgh in 1232. Over the next hundred years, the city prospered under de Burgh rule, until the de Burgh dynasty was sundered in 1333.
Galway requested autonomy and permission to build its own wall in 1396, and came to be governed by a collection of merchant families, who were later dubbed the Tribes of Galway. The city became somewhat distinct, though not totally different, to its Gaelic neighbours from then on.</p>
<h2 id="h2">Medieval Times</h2>
<p>Galway received itself charter in 1484. During the Middle Ages, Galway became a major center of trade with Spain and France in Ireland, and is theorised to have had a population of around three thousand during this time. Even so, during this time Galway had difficult
relations with its Gaelic neighbours, with ordnances forbidding Irish residents from owning property in the town. Nonetheless, there were still signs of assimilation into the Gaelic society around the city. In spite of turmoil in the later 1500s, Galway kept hold of its distinctive character,
though the situation there caused cynicism and caution in the traders there. Galway was used as an adminstrative center for the English, though the decline of the city in the 1600s ended this and ensured Galway's status as a backwater for centuries.  </p>
<h2 id="h2">18th and 19th Centuries</h2>
<p>As a Catholic city, Galway was treated with some suspicion by English authorities as a result of the wars of the 17th century. New Catholics were forbidden from settling there once more, and when fears of a French landing in Galway returned in 1708, all Catholics were ordered to leave the city.
This greatly damaged trade in the area, and the Galway port was practically abandoned as a result. Locals made up for this by smuggling. The 1755 earthquake in Lisbon caused a tsunami that heavily damaged the Spanish Arch area of the city. Galway's prosperity ebbed and flowed
in the 19th century, with a final rebound occurring as a result of the city being connected to the railway network and the founding of NUIG in 1845, then named Queen's University of Ireland.
</p>
<h2 id="h2">20th Century</h2>
<p>The early 20th century was turbulent for Galway. While the Irish revolutionary period of 1913-1923 did not impact the city much, there was unrest and fear of British retribution during the War of Independence, as the nearby town of Tuam had been sacked by British forces and a priest was abducted and shot in November 1920.
The Civil War also had an impact as there were confrontations between the National Army and the Anti-Treaty IRA around places such as Renmore. A number of buildings were burned by the Anti-Treaty forces before they abandoned the city. 
In 1963, President John F Kennedy visited the city mere months before his assassination to a rapturous reception.
On August 16th, 1971, a major fire destroyed much of the city centre, before being redeveloped into the Eyre Square and Edward Square shopping centers.
