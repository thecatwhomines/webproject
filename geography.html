<p>Galway isn't just a city and a bunch of towns. There are some amazing natural sights and sounds that you can see for yourself if you travel off the beaten path.</p>
<h2 id="h2">Connemara National Park</h2>
<figure><img src="connemara.jpg" alt="Connemara viewed from Diamond Hill." width="400" height="300"><figcaption>Connemara viewed from Diamond Hill.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Connemara National Park is well to the west of Galway City itself, but it's very much worth the detour if you can spare the time. First opened in 1980, Connemara National Park
is 4,900 acres of wilderness. Connemara is mostly compromised of low-lying bogs, forests, grasslands and some mountains. There is a wide range of animal life in Connemara; in particular,
many different bird species make their home in the National Park. Purple moorgrass makes its known throughout the reserve, making for vivid and colourful viewing throughout the valley.
There is quite a bit of evidence for ancient human habitation of Connemara, with some megalithic tombs going back 4,000 years.

<h2 id="h2">Lough Corrib</h2>

<p>Ireland's second largest lake is a mere stone's throw away from Galway City, so you won't have to travel at all from your hotel to see it. Clocking in at 176 square kilometers,
Lough Corrib lies in Galway County for the most part, with a small sliver of it residing in Mayo. It flows out into the Corrib and flows into the Cregg, the Clare, and the Black River.
While it's reputed to have 365 small islands resting on its surface, it actually has over 1300, the largest of which is Inchagoil Island. A wealth of wildlife lives in and on the lake,
which has been designated a Special Area of Conservation.</p>
<h2 id="h2">River Corrib</h2>
<figure><img src="rivercorrib.jpg" alt="The River Corrib viewed south from the Salmon Weir Bridge" width="400" height="300" ><figcaption>The Corrib viewed south from the Salmon Weir Bridge.</figcaption></figure>
<p>While the Corrib is actually one of Ireland's smallest rivers in terms of length, being only six kilometers from its source in Lough Corrib before it spills out into the Atlantic,
 the Corrib is actually one of the fastest flowing rivers in Europe - and its flow rate of 105 cubic meters a second is second only to the Shannon. The Corrib is very popular with kayakers because of its 
fast flow rate. The river is sometimes split into the Upper and Lower Corrib. There are multiple popular walks that take you up and down the length of the river, making it a relaxing detour from the noise
of city living.</p>
<h2 id="h2">Benbaun</h2>
<figure><img src="benbaunsummit.jpg" alt="The summit of Benbaun" width="400" height="300"><figcaption>The summit of Benbaun.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Benbaun is the highest point in County Galway, coming in at 729 meters, or 2,392 feet. Its name translating to "White Peak" in English is thought to be a reference to the large amount of quartz
at the mountain's summit. Nestled in the Connemara National Forest, there are a multitude of walks one can take to traverse to the summit of the mountain, such as the Owenglin Horseshoe at 20 kilometers, or the Glencorbet Horsehoe at 14 kilometers. </p>
