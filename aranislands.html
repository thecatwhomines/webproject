      <p id="p30">An overview of an exploration of the Aran Islands.</p>
<p>The Aran Islands are home to some of Ireland's most fascinating historical sites, beautiful geography and most welcoming hospitality in the country. Read below about these gorgeous windswept isles. </p>
<h2 id="h2">History</h2>
<p>The first known settlements on the Islands are thought to date back to at least 1100BC, with it being theorised that the first inhabitants of the islands came over to seek refuge from some sort of attack.
Enda of Aran, a priest, founded the Killeany monastery in Inishmore in 490, addition to the several churches built by Saint Brecan around the same time. In the 1300s, the O'Brien family made a castle around the ringfort at Dún Formna.
This castle persisted until Cromwell's soldiers arrived in the 17th century, destroying the castle and all but two churches in Inishmore. A few decades after this, a pirate captain named Thomas Vaughan captured the islands and held them as a fiefdom, raiding Protestant villages there.    
</p>
<h2 id="h2">Things to do</h2>
<p>Once you've made the 30 minute trip to the Islands, you can see many of the aforementioned historical sites for yourself. The Aran Islands are unusually temperate for the West of Ireland, so take advantage of this.
The island has an unusual geography, more similar to the Burren in Co. Clare than anywhere else. As such, it boasts a wide and diverse range of animals and plants. 
If you're interested in rock climbing, the limestone cliffs on the Islands are a good place to practice your craft. When you're done with that, you can easily find yourself a famed Aran Island sweater to keep you warm.
Beyond that, one can also immerse themselves in the Irish language on  the islands; they are an official Gaeltacht, and many older natives were monolingual in Irish well into the 20th century.    
</p>
<h2 id="h2">Places to stay</h2>
<p>Despite their small size and low population, the Aran Islands don't lack for places to stay. One popular destination is the <b>Aran Islands Hotel</b> on Kilronan, with beautiful views of Kilarney Bay and Kilronan Harbour.
Another possible place to stay is <b>Aran Islands Camping</b>, also in Kilronan, if you'd like to indulge in some camping for a closer to nature experience.</p>
