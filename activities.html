      <p id="p30">The highlights of the Galway International Arts Festival, 2024.</p30>
<p>When it comes to festivities and merriment, Galways is perhaps the best place in Ireland to be, with a major festival or citywide activity happening on average once every three days!</p>
<h2 id="h2">Spring Festivals</h2>
<p>Visiting in the Spring? Stop by <b>Tonnta 2025</b>, from the 30th of January to the 2nd of February. Having only started in 2024, Tonnta is a celebration of Galway's bilingual heritage, with plenty of chances to immerse yourself in the Irish language.
If you'd prefer something a bit more festive, there's always the <b>St. Patrick’s Day Festival</b> from the 15th to the 17 of March, complete with everything you could possibly expect from a Paddy's Day celebration, including a myriad of attractions in Salthill and a parade from University Road to Prospect Hill.
In April, there's the <b>Clifden Traditional Music Festival</b> from the 3rd to the 6th of April, featuring a wealth of trad music from many talented performers. Finally, there's the <b>Inishbofin Arts Festival</b> from the 3rd to the 5th of May, on the beautiful island of Inishbofin.</p>
<h2 id="h2">Summer Festivals</h2>
<p>If you're arriving in the warm and sunny(hopefully!) summer months, then you can't go wrong with the <b>Galway Folk Festival</b> coming in June of 2025, with some of the biggest names in Irish folk music playing at Monroe's Tavern and Seapoint Ballroom in Salthill.
Later on in the summer, there's the <b>Galway International Arts Festival</b>, from the 14th to the 27th of July. One of the world's largest arts festivals draws people from all over the world to explore Galway's wealth of culture and artistic talent. There's an abundance of things to see, so pick a date and plow on!
If you're in Galway in August, you can always stop by the <b>Galway Heritage Week</b> from the 16th to the 24th of August. It's a fun exploration of Galway's history and there are events all over the county, from medieval tours to seashore tours. </p>
<h2 id="h2">Autumn Festivals</h2>
<p>If you visit Galway in the autumn, you've got the option of visiting the <b>Galway Culture Night</b> on the 19th of September, to explore all aspects of contemporary Irish life. There's an amazing variety of talks, readings, performances, and films to see and indulge in, all free of charge!
If you want something spookier for October, then you've got a great option in the <b>Galway Halloween Festival</b> from the 24th to the 31st of October. There's a spooktacular parade on the holiday weekend, a comedy festival from the 21st to the 27th, Halloween screenings in the PÁLÁS Cinema, and more!
Once things start to cool down in November, you can stop at any time during the month for the <b>Blas na Samhna Food Festival</b>. All of Galway's best cuisine will be on display, from comforting Irish food to exciting Brazillian and French cuisine, there's something for everyone's palate this month. </p>
<h2 id="h2">Winter Festivals</h2>
<p>Winter's a wonderful time to visit Galway, especially during the <b>Christmas Market</b>, which runs through all of December through to January 5th. Whatever you want to buy for yourself or a family member is available among the many stalls in Eyre Square, so chow down and stock up!
If you'd prefer to indulge in some exploration of Galway during the Christmas season, then it'll be hard to miss the <b>Christmas Lights</b> that light up the whole city. Marvel at the beautiful, festive lighting that illuminates the city, making for perfect photography opportunities and much more.
Finally, feel free to join the <b>Winter Solstice celebration</b> at Brigit's Garden on the 15th of December for some quiet, contemplative reflection on the year that's passed. Light a candle or bring a poem, and share your good vibes and intentions with those around you as the year draws to a close. </p>
