<p>If you're looking for something to eat in Galway, then you won't be lacking for any options, no matter what cuisine you prefer or whatever you're looking for.
Whether you're in the mood for a fancy sit-down meal, or a walk-along snack from a food truck or a market stall, there's an endless amount of options that we'll go into below.</p>
<h2 id="h2">Seafood</h2>

<p>If you're in Galway, there's no doubt that you're looking for delicious and fresh seafood. Your first ports of call should be <b>McDonagh's</b> near Spanish Arch and <b>Hooked</b> on Henry Street - some of the finest fish and chips in Ireland.
If you're still hungry after that, there's always <b>Kirwan's</b> on Kirwan's Lane for a relaxed sit-down experience. If you're still hankering for some fresh fish, there's also <b>Oscar's Seafood Bistro</b> on Dominick Street.</p>
<h2 id="h2">Pizza</h2>

<p>Sometimes, you just want a slice or two of pizza to take along with you on your journey. Galway does not lack for options in this regard, starting with <b>Dough Bros</b> on Middle Street for some of the best pizza on the West Coast, having been voted the 15th best pizzeria in the world!
If that's not enough for you, try <b>Napoli</b> on Cross Street, or <b>Woozza's</b> on the Sea Road. </p>
<h2 id="h2">Gastropubs</h2>

<p>There's nothing so refreshing as a good plate of food next to a well-poured pint. For this, try <b>An Púcán</b> on Forster Street, or the <b>Front Door Pub</b> on Cross Street. If you're looking to stay close to the city center, you can rest at <b>The King's Head</b> on High Street
or <b>Taaffe's</b> on Shop Street.</p>
<h2 id="h2">Vegetarian and vegan options</h2>

<p>If you don't eat meat or animal products, there are still plenty of options for you to choose from in Galway. Chief among them is <b>Bierhaus</b> on Henry Street, where everything is both vegetarian and vegan friendly, and their vegan burger is the talk of the city!
Apart from that there's also the <b>Lighthouse Cafe</b>, situated on Abbeygate Street. They have a beloved daily special hotpot for the colder days on Galway's Atlantic coast. If that's not enough, you can visit <b>Ré Nao</b>, a restaurant that specialises in Asian and Chinese cuisine.</p>
<h2 id="h2">Sweets and desert options</h2>
<figure><img src="harrys.jpg"class="responsive" alt="Harry's, bar and popular dessert location."></figure><figcaption>Harry's Bar.</figcaption>
<p>When dinner's done, you always need something sweet to help wash the savoury stuff down. To that end, there are many great places to satisfy your sweet tooth in Galway, like <b>Harry's Bar</b> on Bohermore,
which lets you customise your own brownie with whatever toppings you wish. Another local favourite is <b>Freddy's</b> on Quay Street in the Latin Quarter, whose weekly special tiramisu has become famous.</p>
<h2 id="h2">Food trucks</h2>
<figure><img src="pratai.jpg" class="responsive" alt="Pratai, popular chip food truck."></figure><figcaption>Pratai's menu.</figcaption>
<p>Need something quick and on the go? Galway has you covered! You can stop by <b>Prataí</b> for some delicious chips, freshly made and topped with whatever delicious sauce you might want, or the new and upcoming
<b>Féasta</b>, which does vegetarian and gluten free Mexican food. Both of these food trucks can be found at the Galway Markets.</p>
