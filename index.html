        <h2 id="h2">Welcome to the home page!</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Galway, Ireland's Atlantic getaway! As one of Ireland's largest cities and largest counties, Galway represents a prime destination for any tourist, and a wonderful place to live for anyone looking to put down roots.</p>
        <p>This website will serve as a quick informational guide to this beautiful part of Ireland. Whether you're a newcomer to this part of the country, or you've lived here your entire life, you'll find something interesting or useful here.</p>
        <p>This website can take you through what different activities there are in Galway, as this idyllic oceanic destination has much more to offer than even a seasoned traveller may be aware of. Whether it be in the windswept islands off the county's coasts, the bustling city streets from Eyre Square to the Spanish Arch, or the wholesome and quaint smaller towns dotted across the county, you'll never be bored.</p>
        <p>And when you settle down after hours of bountiful exploring, Galway hosts a wealth of exquisite restaurants to sate your hunger, before you head to one of Galway's many lovely hotels and hostels to rest your head for the night, ready for another day of exploration and revelling. 
        And if that's not enough for you, feel free to regale yourself on the tales of Galway's rich and ancient history, stretching back over a thousand years to the time of the Norman Conquest. </p>
        <p> And in addition to all of this, near the coast of Galway, a mere 30 minute ferry journey away, the Aran Islands await - a window into Ireland's past, with hillforts and churches that date back further than almost any historical sites on the mainland. </p>
